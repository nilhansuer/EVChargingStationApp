## ABSTRACT
 Electric car users often need to charge their cars on in different places and they spend a
 lot of time there during car charging. However, they sometimes can’t find any activity to do
 there such as having a coffee, shopping, walking or fitness… And then they decide to change
 their charging location or they want to leave before charging process is completed. So, this
 application solves this problem. It offers various activity recommendations for electric car
 users according to their habits and demands while charging their cars. For example, if the
 user has children and always prefers the locations that have playgrounds, then the application
 will automatically search for the nearest available charging station that is suitable for the
 families having children and recommend that location where the previous users also have a
 good time with their families during charging. The recommendations are decided using AI,
 machine learning and decision support algorithms based on the opportunities in that location
 and preferences of both the current user and the previous users who have visited the related
 charging stations. In addition, the application will be user-friendly, so that the users can easily
 access the application whenever they need.
